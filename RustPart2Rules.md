Rules for Types in RUST
==========================

Rust is a relatively new language and the documentation and Forums were not very clear as to how Name and Structural Equivalence was used.
So, we have defined our own rules for the same.

- Primitive Types: Name Equivalence along with Internal Name Equivalence
- Aliased Types: Name Equivalence along with Internal Name Equivalence
- Functions: Structural Equivalence
- Struct: Structural Equivalence
- Array: Structural Equivalence
